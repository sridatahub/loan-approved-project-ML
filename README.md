Problem Statement

Given applicant information (gender, marital status, income, loan amount, credit history, etc.), predict whether a loan will be approved (Y) or not (N). This is a binary classification problem.

Dataset Overview

Original dataset shape: 614 rows Ã— 13 columns.

Columns (as in your notebook):

Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, Loan_Status.

Key summary statistics (numerical features)

ApplicantIncome: mean = 5403.459283, std = 6109.041673, min = 150, max = 81000.

CoapplicantIncome: mean = 1621.245798, std = 2926.248369.

LoanAmount: mean = 146.412162, std = 85.587325, count = 592 (22 missing originally).

Loan_Amount_Term: mean = 342.0 (median 360.0), some values like 12, 480 exist.

Credit_History: mean = 0.842199, count = 564 (50 missing originally).

Missing values before cleaning (per your run):
